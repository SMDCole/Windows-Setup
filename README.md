# Windows-Setup
A setup script and resources for new systems coming through SystemsMD

NOTE: Automate does not install yet. That is a WIP. Any errors are because the corresponding XApp is not installed. This varies from SI to SI. I've tried to minimize the number of errors that occur

Run this in Powershell admin

```iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JRX47'))``` 

Or

```iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SMDCole/Windows-Setup/MASTER/WindowsSetup-WIP.ps1'))```
